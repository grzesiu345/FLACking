![how it looks like](blob:https://github.com/1d06eb5a-91dd-43bc-af00-b0629323fd20)
## How it works?
normally, just put music (with cover.jpg) in right directory and it should be working.

Like this example:

music / Kanye West / Graduation / 01. Good Morning.flac

music directory can be changed, at main.py.
